## Objectives
The objective of this project is to demonstrate a methodological set of steps in the design of a software architecture for a set of requirements provided by your instructor. The expected design approach to take is the Attribute Driven Design (ADD) presented in some detail in the text book [1] and briefly overviewed here.  

## The ADD process 
The  ADD  process  takes  a  set  of  requirements  as  inputs  and  expects  an  architecture  design  and  description as output as shown in the diagram below.

The ADD is a 7 step process as shown in the figure below with the expectation of 2-3 iteration steps of the process.

One of the most common types of software systems is the greenfield systems in mature domains type of system,  that is a new system but based on existing architecture patterns and styles. In this type of system the norm is to perform 3 iterations of the ADD method with the respective goals of i) defining the structure of the system, ii) defining the components of the architecture to achieve the functional requirements of the systems, and iii) refactoring the architecture to achieve the quality requirements of the system. These goals and design concepts for each iteration is shown in the figure below.

## Deliverables
The expectation is to submit a set of artifacts in a GitHub classroom repository that your instructor will create for you that demonstrates the ADD steps as applied to the design of an architecture for astudent defined project.  

All deliverables should be uploaded to a GitHub repository that the instructor will set up. Individual contributions in the project will be graded the based-on GitHub commitments of the deliverables and use  of  the  KanBan  project  board  available  in  GitHub.  A  good  way  to  manage  your  project  is  by  leveraging the Issues tagging available through GitHub and the automated KanBan project board.

### Deliverable 1 – Project proposal (Due Oct 18)
Project group members should submit a project proposal preferably of some software project they are familiar  with  such  as  one  they  have  already  worked  on  in  other  courses.  This  deliverable  should contain title of the project, list of group members, and a set of functional and non-requirements.  

### Deliverable 2 – Project progress report (Due Nov. 8)
Prior to commencing the ADD process the use cases, quality attributes and constraint requirements of the project need to be defined based on the requirements that you submitted. The format of these submissions should follow closely the FCAPS case example in the text book [1].

Expected artifacts are:
- Use Case Model
- Quality Attributes for the use case
- System Constrains for the use case

### Deliverable 3 – Design of the Use Case (Due Dec. 6)
This  portion  of  the  project  should  follow  the  ADD  design  process.  The  format  of  the  submission  should mimic the FCAPS case example in the text book [1]. All 3 iterations of the design process are expected and all 7 steps should be included. 

## Grading Scheme
- Proposal: 2 marks
- Progress Report: 3 marks
- Design Submission: 25 marks
- Presentation: 5 marks

## Team Assessment
As a requirement of the course there is a team assessment that should be completed. The purpose of this  team  evaluation  is  for  students  to  understand  the  dynamics  and  roles  of  a  team.  This  will  be  assessed using the ITP metrics tool and instructions will be posted in Canvas.
