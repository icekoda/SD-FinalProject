# Iteration 2 - Identifying Structures to Support Primary Functionality 

This section presents the results of the activities that are performed in each of the steps
of ADD in the second iteration of the design process for the FCAPS system. We move from the generic and
coarse-grained descriptions of functionality used in iteration 1 to more detailed
decisions that will drive imple-mentation and hence the formation of development teams. 

## Goal

> Reason about the units of implementation, which affect team formation, interfaces, and the means by
  which development tasks may be distributed, outsourced, and implemented in sprints.
  
## Step 2: Establish Iteration Goal by Selecting Drivers
The goal of this iteration is  to address the general architectural concern of identifying structures
to support primary functionality. In the second iteration, the architect considers the system's primary
use cases:
- UC-1
- UC-3

# Step 3: Choose One or More Elements of the System to Refine 
# Step 4: Choose One or More Design Concepts That Satisfy the Selected Drivers
